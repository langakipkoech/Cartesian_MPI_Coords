# Cartesian_MPI_Coords
The goal of this project is to mixup pixel values of an image using cyclic rotation of rows and column values utilizing MPI and observing the resultant image

# Cartesian MPI Coordinates

This project demonstrates using MPI to perform cyclic rotations on an image matrix using a 4 Ã— 12 process grid. The program reads matrix data, applies transformations based on input commands, and prints the transformed image.
